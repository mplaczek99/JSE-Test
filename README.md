# JSE-Test

Implements a **JavaScript CLI script** that processes two JSON input files  
(`event_details.json` and `references.json`) and outputs structured JSON results.  

Built and tested with **Node.js LTS 22**.  
Includes clear design documentation, reproducible execution steps, and attention to readability, reusability, and deterministic behavior.
