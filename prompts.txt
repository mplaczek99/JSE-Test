Tool: ChatGPT
Purpose: I requested brief examples to sanity-check approach and output shape. I implemented and tested the final code myself

Prompts I asked:
1) In JavaScript, show an example that reads two JSON files and prints one JSON object
2) Give a short example of grouping by a time period and tallying categories
3) Share an example of summarizing numbers and selecting items based on simple criteria
4) Provide an example of filtering items above a threshold and listing related labels
5) In MarkDown, generate a minimal README and a brief design note
6) Show a strict YYYY-MM-DD parsing example that rejects invalid dates
7) Give an example of building fast lookups from IDs to items
