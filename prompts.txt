Purpose: I requested brief examples to sanity-check approach and output shape. I implemented and tested the final code myself

Prompts I asked:
1) In JavaScript, show an example that reads two JSON files and prints one JSON object
2) Give a short example of grouping by a time period and tallying categories
3) Share an example of summarizing numbers and selecting items based on simple criteria
4) Provide an example of filtering items above a threshold and listing related labels
5) In MarkDown, generate a minimal README and a brief design note
6) Show a strict YYYY-MM-DD parsing example that rejects invalid dates
7) Give an example of building fast lookups from IDs to items
8) Provide a tiny example of joining items to names via a reference list
9) Show how to break ties alphabetically for deterministic results
10) Give an example that ensures zero defaults for missing categories
11) Show an example that guarantees exactly one JSON object is printed with no extra logs
12) Provide an example that sorts labels alphabetically
13) Show a pattern for separating data loading from pure computation functions
14) Share a tiny example of ignoring unknown categories while keeping required keys
15) Give an example that chooses the earliest valid date while skipping malformed ones
16) Show a short snippet that deduplicates items referenced multiple ways
17) Provide a tiny example for stable output ordering of object keys
